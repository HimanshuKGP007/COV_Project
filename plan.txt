To Do: 

- Rewrite Abstract 
- Framework diagram - DONE v1.0
- Ensemble Model Diagram - flowchart - DONE v1.0
- Models' summary - Box Result --> Accuracy + Recall/Sensitivity of identifying COVID +ve - DONE
- ScreenShot/type the equations - DONE
- Replace cough with cough audio/cough recording
- Rearrange Sentences in Methodology 
- Classifier Architectures - DONE
- Classification Process (Ensemble) flowchart - DONE v1.0
- MFCC Block diagram ----------------------------------------------------------------- TBD
- Corresponding Figure for feature explanation - DONE 
- Figure and Table numbers
- Add LIME and SHAP explanation - https://interpret.ml/docs/blackbox.html 
- Save the trained model for future use
- DSP Chipset Research
- Websites Accessed Section
- Research Paper Format - Use Template ----------------------------------------------- TBD
- Edit Waveform - DONE
- Cross Validation Writeup ----------------------------------------------------------- TBD
- Margin Differencec -- *IMP*


Optional:

- Plotly ROC Curves
- Plot the Spectral Features in one Plot 
- SHAP Explanation
- Weights and Biases Code *IMP*
- AUC in Abstract 
- Naive Bayes Algorithm 
- Evaluation mechanism, file:///C:/Kgp/CP/Preparation/COVID%20Project/Audio%20Files/Research%20Papers/COVID%20Cough%20Papers/DTree.pdf 


Main Talking Points:

- Explainability (XAI)
- Ensemble Model


Doubts:
- SMOTE explanation required?
- What else to be written in Abstract
- Ensemble Model Explanation required?
- Per Class Metrics
- Results Box --- Overall/COVID +ve -- Used COVID -- Done
- Comment on already existing Testing methods


APP DEVELOPEMENT:

Plan: 
Test App:
1. Record cough audio (RESEARCH) --> 2 ways: Python WAV or Streamlit WAV
2. MP3/OGG --> WAV
3. Feature Extraction
4. Data Scaling (RESEARCH)(CODE) - Found
5. Passing through Model
6. Result


Guitar App:
- Model Info
- Training
- Classes
- Data Scaling


New Data:
- EDA
- SMOTE
- Model Training
- Evaluation
