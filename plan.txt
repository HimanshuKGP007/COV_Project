APP DEVELOPEMENT:

Plan: 
Test App:
1. Record cough audio (RESEARCH) --> 2 ways: Python WAV(DOUBT) or Streamlit WAV(Go with this) --> Take from Guitar APP
2. MP3/OGG --> WAV
3. Feature Extraction --> Add code in predict() in src\model.py
4. Data Scaling (RESEARCH)(CODE) - Found
5. Passing through Model
6. Result

model.py --> train.py --> test.py

Guitar App:
- Model Info
- Training
- Classes
- Data Scaling


New Data:
- EDA
- SMOTE
- Model Training
- Evaluation
