APP DEVELOPEMENT + LINKS:

Plan: 
Test App:
1. Record cough audio (RESEARCH) --> 2 ways: Python WAV(DOUBT) or Streamlit WAV(Go with this) --> Take from Guitar APP
2. MP3/OGG --> WAV -- Done
3. Feature Extraction --> Add code in predict() in src\model.py -- Done
4. Data Scaling (RESEARCH)(CODE) - Done
5. Passing through Model
6. Result -- Review
7. Deploying issues -- Heroku


model.py --> train.py --> test.py


Guitar App:
- Model Info
- Training
- Classes
- Data Scaling


App Developements:

- PyWebIO ---> Serves Streamlit purpose
- Data for Training App --> https://www.kaggle.com/himanshu007121/coswara-data-extraction 
- Cloud Audio Recorder - https://imclient.herokuapp.com/audiorecorder/ , https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStream_Recording_API/Using_the_MediaStream_Recording_API
- Reference Issue: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62365299/deploy-django-app-using-pyaudio-library-to-heroku , https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68108052/an-audio-recorder-work-around-that-doesnt-use-portaudio-for-a-streamlit-webapp 

New Data:
- EDA - DONE
- SMOTE - DONE
- Model Training - DONE
- Evaluation - DONE

- Work on smote function - DONE

PLAN:

- EDA of covid metrics for wave 1 and 2 --> Q: Does cough signal/sounds in different signals differ? --> Data ready, EDA left --> Source: https://www.kaggle.com/himanshu007121/first-wave/ + https://www.kaggle.com/himanshu007121/second-wave-dataset --> NB: https://www.kaggle.com/himanshu007121/dtale-1 , Number of daily cases: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/india/ -- DONE 
  - chroma_Stft very significant --> extract all 8 separately
  - use those 8 to see the importance, find most important octave
- Cough Detection Model
- Envelope of coughing sound -- (Plot)Fourier Transform to find Frequency Range/Bandwidths -- Try to link with Vocal Chords
- BTP report - TBD on Overleaf, writeup on Grammarly
  - Documentation of App Developements -- DONE (atm)
  - Documentation of comparison of waves -- DONE (atm)
- Research and Datasets on Different diseases -- Compare with COVID (MFCC's) (Look For boxplots in plotly -- same research as COVID multi waves)
  - COPD Data Extracted --> https://www.kaggle.com/himanshu007121/copd-covid-similarities 
- classification of waves on the basis of 5 features(DONE) + other diseases
