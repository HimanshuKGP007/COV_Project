APP DEVELOPEMENT + LINKS: --> DONE

Plan: 
Test App:
1. Record cough audio (RESEARCH) --> 2 ways: Python WAV(DOUBT) or Streamlit WAV(Go with this) --> Take from Guitar APP
2. MP3/OGG --> WAV -- Done
3. Feature Extraction --> Add code in predict() in src\model.py -- Done
4. Data Scaling (RESEARCH)(CODE) - Done
5. Passing through Model
6. Result -- Review
7. Deploying issues -- Heroku


model.py --> train.py --> test.py

- Cloud Audio Recorder - https://imclient.herokuapp.com/audiorecorder/ , https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStream_Recording_API/Using_the_MediaStream_Recording_API
- Reference Issue: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62365299/deploy-django-app-using-pyaudio-library-to-heroku , https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68108052/an-audio-recorder-work-around-that-doesnt-use-portaudio-for-a-streamlit-webapp 

New Data:
- EDA - DONE
- SMOTE - DONE
- Model Training - DONE
- Evaluation - DONE

- Work on smote function - DONE

ONGOING PLAN - OCT 2021:

- EDA of covid metrics for wave 1 and 2 --> Q: Does cough signal/sounds in different signals differ? --> Data ready, EDA left --> Source: https://www.kaggle.com/himanshu007121/first-wave/ + https://www.kaggle.com/himanshu007121/second-wave-dataset --> NB: https://www.kaggle.com/himanshu007121/dtale-1 , Number of daily cases: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/india/ -- DONE 
  - chroma_Stft very significant --> extract all 8 separately
  - use those 8 to see the importance, find most important octave

- Cough Detection Model
  - https://github.com/mdabdk/Cough-Detection --> Dataset + Code Ideas; https://drive.google.com/file/d/19XyGihClOE4Vn0dM0IqQI1wA8NfZ9SQI/view --> Dataset ZIP
  - https://www.kaggle.com/digvijayyadav/cough-analysis-with-mobilenet & https://www.kaggle.com/himanshu007121/cough-analysis-with-mobilenet/edit --> Cough Detection using Tensorflow + VERY BIASED
  - Using https://www.kaggle.com/mmoreaux/environmental-sound-classification-50 + (COUGH Sounds)
  - https://www.kaggle.com/doofensmirtz/85-validation-accuracy-tensorflow --> Code and Dataset ZIP + Cough Sounds
  - https://github.com/AlexGz9851/CoughDetection + https://www.kaggle.com/himanshu007121/hmm-cough-detection --> Cough Detection using Hidden Markov Models 

- Envelope of coughing sound -- (Plot)Fourier Transform to find Frequency Range/Bandwidths 
  - https://www.kaggle.com/himanshu007121/eda-on-the-frequency-domain-fft
  - Review Notion
  - https://www.kaggle.com/himanshu007121/testing-spectral-comparison-techniques  
  - Initial Idea: 
1. Extract FFT Values from all the voice recordings
2. Extract associated frequencies from these FFT coefficients 
3. The FFT coefficients can be used as features to represent the signal ([https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3694918/how-to-extract-frequency-associated-with-fft-values-in-python](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3694918/how-to-extract-frequency-associated-with-fft-values-in-python)) 
  - Try to link with Vocal Chords

- BTP report - TBD on Overleaf, writeup on Grammarly
  - Completed the Research Paper matter writeup
  - Ongoing:
    - Writeup of above headings
    - Compiling all the writeups in the required format
  - Documentation of App Developements -- DONE (atm)
  - Documentation of comparison of waves -- DONE (atm)
  - Documentation of comparison of COPD and COVID audio recordings -- TBD
  - Documentation of comparison of frequencies of COVID and Non-covid audio recordings -- TBD -- Not to be included in Report
  - Arranging all the documentations in one place -- WORD -- Ongoing

- Research and Datasets on Different diseases -- Compare with COVID (MFCC's) (Look For boxplots in plotly -- same research as COVID multi waves)
  - COPD Data Extracted --> https://www.kaggle.com/himanshu007121/copd-covid-similarities 

- classification of waves on the basis of 5 features(DONE) + other diseases
